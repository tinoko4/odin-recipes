    <h3>Lasagna</h3>
        <p>Fried chicken, also called Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned 
            flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the 
            exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients List</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Directions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). 
            Season flour with paprika (which helps to brown the chicken), salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, transfer them into the bag with flour; seal the bag 
            and shake to coat well.</li>

        <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. 
            <strong>LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</strong></li>

        <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
        <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li>

        <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for <strong>30 minutes</strong> (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). 
            Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy. </li>
        <li>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished 
            chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
