    <h3>Korean BBQ Short Ribs (Galbi)</h3>
        <p>A popular method in Korean cuisine of grilling meat, typically beef, pork or chicken. 
           Such dishes are often prepared on gas or charcoal grills built into the dining table itself, 
           though some restaurants provide customers with portable stoves for diners to use at their tables. 
           Alternatively, a chef uses a centrally displayed grill to prepare dishes that are made to order.</p>
